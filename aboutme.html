    <h2>About Me</h2><br>
    <p>Hi, I'm Navaneeth, a passionate self-taught developer with a strong focus on building modern and visually engaging websites. I have been diving deep into front-end and full-stack development, constantly pushing my skills to create sleek, interactive, and immersive user experiences.

        Currently, Iâ€™m working on a gaming-inspired project, blending cyberpunk aesthetics, neon effects, and interactive elements to bring a unique and futuristic feel to the platform. I love experimenting with CSS animations, shadow effects, hover interactions, and seamless UI/UX designs to make my projects stand out.
        
        My journey into web development has been completely self-drivenâ€”I enjoy problem-solving, debugging, and refining every detail until the final product is both functional and visually stunning. From implementing video overlays, sound controls, and dynamic layouts to ensuring everything is fully responsive, I aim to create web experiences that are as smooth as they are engaging.
        
        With each project, Iâ€™m learning, refining, and taking my skills to the next level. Stay tuned for more exciting developments! ðŸš€</p>
